Daydream Global Submission - Payload!
<br>
Payload is a platformer where you are given blocks as a way to double-jump and to buy items like consumables, armour, and upgrades.
<br>
There is a balance, however.
<br>
When you double-jump, you are sacrificing some of your currency to survive by jumping higher.
<br>
Be careful not to spend too much or waste extra jumps! Or you may not survive this maze...

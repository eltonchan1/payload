Daydream Global Submission - Payload!
<br>
W, A, D (or arrow keys) - jump, left, right
<br>
S (or down arrow) - interact with shop
<br>
Shift, Q - inventory
<br>
Esc - pause/exit
<br>
Payload is a platformer where you are given blocks as a way to double-jump and to buy items like consumables, armour, and upgrades.
<br>
There is a balance, however.
<br>
When you double-jump, you are sacrificing some of your currency to survive by jumping higher.
<br>
Be careful not to spend too much or waste extra jumps! Or you may not survive this maze...
